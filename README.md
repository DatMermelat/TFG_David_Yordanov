# Description
This repository contains code used for a bachelor's degree project aimed at evaluating the performance of a Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (HVAE) for symbolic regression. The original, unmodified HVAE model and instructions on how to install it are available at: [https://github.com/smeznar/HVAE](https://github.com/smeznar/HVAE)

The exclusive scripts written for the experiments carried out in the project are:
1. _normal_sampling.py_
2. _random_walk.py_
3. _reconstruction_experiment.py_
4. _mse_regeression.py_
5. _mse_sim_annealing.py_

Script outputs and additional data representation tools are available in the _TFG_results_ directory.
